    //       The pre-selection process requires advertisement in local mass media
    //       to inform the workers about the job. Merchant Overseas has a broad
    //       computer database of all current and potential future applicants who
    //       come from across the country with a variety of skills and qualities.
    //       The whole pre-selection process is run by our own recruiting manager
    //       and executives based on following criteria : <br /> 1. Capability <br /> 2.
    //       Competency <br /> 3. Knowledge <br /> 4. Experience <br /> 5. Finishing of job and quality
    //       of job performed. <br />
    //       Final Selection & Deployment Process : <br />
    //       We always
    //       prefer selection of workers either by oral or practical test to be
    //       directed by the employer or his/her authorized representative. We
    //       arrange his/her/their housing, transport and all other logistic
    //       support required for the purpose. If we are given the responsibility
    //       of selecting and testing our workers, we usually do it with the help
    //       of a team of experts for the technical and professional department
    //       under the direct super-vision of our professional executives at our
    //       industrial trade test center. Testing facilities for complex
    //       engineering functions are available at our training center premises in
    //       Banani, Dhaka, attaching to the most advanced processes and techniques
    //       used at that time. <br />
    //       Web Based Workers Management System: Here at
    //       Merchant Overseas, we maintain a custom-built web-based project
    //       management application software so that our partners (employers,
    //       project stakeholders, etc.) can monitor the progress of each
    //       individual processing work as it happens. We are constantly updating
    //       each employee’s file in our management application system. Once a
    //       project is signed, we provide the employer with a user ID and password
    //       to access the system. Documentation:
    //       <br />
    //       Merchant Overseas also assumes
    //       the responsibility of submitting the required documents to the clients
    //       such as passport copy, visa copy, bio-data, photograph, health
    //       certificate, certificate of academic qualification, employment
    //       contract and other necessary documents which are collected from
    //       workers. Each worker is assigned with his or her own personal file
    //       which usually contains the above documents. Merchant Overseas also
    //       obtains the necessary permits from relevant government agencies and
    //       legal entities.
    //       <br />
    //        Validation of Proper Documentation: Unlike other
    //       recruiting agencies, we only collect documents and compile them into
    //       workers personal files but we also do our best to verify the
    //       originality of those documents. For example, we check the originality
    //       of educational documents with the board of education and check police
    //       records to make sure that the workers are recruited by our
    //       organization have a clear record. <br /> Medical Checkup: <br /> After passing the
    //       final stage of selection, a worker is sent for a medical checkup at
    //       the modern and approved medical center of the respective embassy of
    //       the country of employment. These medical facilities maintain strict
    //       obedience to international standards. For the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
    //       prospective workers are required by law to undergo a medical check-up
    //       at a GAMCA-approved medical center. Our workers usually go through the
    //       following check-ups: <br /> 1. Routine Urine Test <br /> 2. HBsAg, TPHA, HIV,
    //       Anti-HCV <br /> 3. RBS, S Bilirubin, SGPT, SGOT, Creatine, Cholesterol <br /> 4.
    //       Wilda Test <br /> 5. X-Ray, TB <br />
    //       Application and Receipt of Visa: On behalf of
    //       the selected workers, Merchant Overseas applies for a visa at the
    //       relevant embassy as approved by the employer. For countries like the
    //       UAE, Qatar, and Oman, we send complete sets of documents so that our
    //       clients can submit visa applications to their respective ministries of
    //       particular country for processing. <br />
    //        Upon receipt of a visa from
    //       Concerned Embassy: <br /> 1. To protect the rights of workers, the terms of
    //       the final agreement will be combined with the employment agreement. <br /> 2.
    //       All documentation will be prepared as required. <br /> 3. All required
    //       documents are submitted to BMET for getting emigration clearance. We
    //       strongly believe that an worker should be outspoken enough to be
    //       present at work. We work with them on the necessary soft skill
    //       development before deploying them.
